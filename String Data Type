Introducing the string data type
<!-- This statement that creates a variable named myString and assigns it the value "This is a string.". -->
myString = "This is a string."
<!-- script by using the built-in function type() to get the data type of the variable -->
print(type(myString))
<!-- To convert the return value of type into a string, use the str() built-in function: -->
print(myString + " is of the data type " + str(type(myString)))
<!-- Create two strings and then concatenate them -->
firstString = "water"
secondString = "fall"
thirdString = firstString + secondString
print(thirdString)
<!-- use a built-in function named input() to get information from the user. -->
name = input("What is your name? ")
