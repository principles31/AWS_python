Working with a while loop
<!-- Use the print() function to inform the user about your game: -->
import random
print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")
<!-- statement that will generate a random number between 1 and 10 by using the randint() function of the random module. -->
number = random.randint(1,10)
<!-- Track whether the user guessed your number by creating a variable called isGuessRight: -->
isGuessRight = False
<!-- To handle the game logic, create a while loop: -->
while isGuessRight != True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    if int(guess) == number:
        print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
        isGuessRight = True
    else:
        print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))
    <!-- To inform the user about your script, use the print() function:     -->
    print("Count to 10!")
    <!-- Return to the Python script. To count to 10, -->
for x in range (0, 11):
    print(x)
